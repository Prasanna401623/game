### SCENE 1.1: Outside the School
**Location:** School Building, Morning  
**Characters:** Narrator  
**Source File:** Story/Backstory/scene1_school.rpy

**NARRATOR:**  
The school building sits under the morning sun, its modern facade bright and clean. Trimmed bushes line the entrance. Trees sway gently in the breeze. Everything looks ordinary. But today isn't ordinary at all.

*(Music: laststop-school.mp3 begins)*

**NARRATOR:**  
Inside, a challenge waits. It will demand more than technical skill.

### SCENE 1.2: The Hallway
**Location:** School Hallway  
**Characters:** Harry, Kendall, Narrator  
**Source File:** Story/Backstory/scene2_hallway.rpy

**NARRATOR:**  
The hallway is quiet, with only a few students lingering near their lockers. Harry spots Kendall walking ahead and hurries to catch up.

**HARRY:**  
Hey, Kendall! Wait up!

**KENDALL:**  
Oh, hey Harry. How's it going?

**HARRY:**  
Not bad. Just another day at the coding grind. How about you?

**KENDALL:**  
Same here. Though, I'm hoping today won't be too crazy. I need a break from these puzzles.

**HARRY:**  
Don't count on it. This is Professor Carter we're talking about. He probably dreams of ways to make our lives harder.

**KENDALL:**  
You're probably right. What do you think he's got planned for today?

**HARRY:**  
Whatever it is, I'm ready. Bring it on!

**KENDALL:**  
I wish I had your confidence. Loops are already tricky enough without Carter throwing in some wild twist.

**HARRY:**  
Loops aren't so bad. They're just repetitive logic. Once you crack the pattern, it's easy.

**KENDALL:**  
That's easy for you to say, Mr. 'Coding Comes Naturally to Me.'

**HARRY:**  
It's not magic, Kendall. It's just practice. Besides, Carter's challenges are always fun.

**KENDALL:**  
Fun, huh? Tell that to my sleep schedule. Recursion last week nearly broke me.

**HARRY:**  
You made it through, though. That's what counts.

**KENDALL:**  
Barely. Let's just hope today's challenge doesn't involve anything crazy. I'd like one normal day for a change.

**NARRATOR:**  
They reach the classroom door. Students are chatting inside.

**KENDALL:**  
Here we go. Let's see what Carter has up his sleeve today.

**HARRY:**  
I bet it's going to be something fun.

### SCENE 1.3: The Classroom
**Location:** Classroom  
**Characters:** Professor Carter, Harry, Kendall, Narrator  
**Source File:** Story/Backstory/scene3_classroom.rpy

**NARRATOR:**  
The classroom is bright and full of students. Laptops are open, and everyone's talking about what's coming next.

**PROFESSOR CARTER:**  
Alright, class, settle down. Today, we're diving into something exciting. A challenge that will test your coding skills.

**HARRY:**  
I knew it! Another one of Carter's challenges. I can't wait!

**KENDALL:**  
I'm not so sure about this. Recursion last week was tough enough. What's it going to be this time?

**PROFESSOR CARTER:**  
Loops! Specifically, pre-test loops. And to make it more interesting, you'll be solving a virtual maze.

**HARRY:**  
A virtual maze? That sounds awesome!

**NARRATOR:**  
The room goes quiet. The maze appears on the projector screen—twisting paths lit up in neon colors.

**HARRY:**  
This is going to be fun! I've always wanted to try something like this.

**KENDALL:**  
Fun? Speak for yourself. I'm already nervous.

**PROFESSOR CARTER:**  
This challenge is about teamwork, logic, and precision. Make every loop count. Are you ready?

**NARRATOR:**  
Students start getting ready for the challenge.
